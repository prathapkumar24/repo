# repo


I have integrated the design in two ways


1. Created template with basic format. the file path is repo/machine_test

2. Integrated the template to the yii2 framework

Please follow the steps to run the template in yii2 framework.

take pull the repo/project1

goto the project folder in cmd.

run the command "composer update" and "php init"

goto localhost/repo/project1 

you can see the template view

Thanking you
